    <h3> Egyptians - Pioneers of Baking</h3>
    <p>Egyptians were at the forefront of baking which can be traced as far back as 2600 B.C. and are the reason we use yeast in bread today, although scholars debate the exact origin, as evidence suggests that Mesopotamians also produced yeast-risen bread.
        Egyptian bread was made almost exclusively from emmer wheat, which was more difficult to turn into flour than most other varieties of wheat.</p>
